# Reviewer-Notes
A repository for reviewers to save what they learn and what they would like to share with our students.

Note to contributors:<br>
The documents in this repo are Markdown files. To preview your changes locally it's helpful to have a Chrome extension like [Markdown Preview][1], which will appropriately render Markdown files in your browser.
