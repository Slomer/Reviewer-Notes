* **Ability to delete comments on Code Review tab** <br>
Sometimes I'll save a comment, but later on it doesn't mesh well with my other ones.

* **Ability to save feedback on Project Review tab** <br>
If you ever refresh the page while doing a review you will lose any feedback left in the Project Review area. A lot of us refresh to get the correct comment count to show up on the Code Review tab, which means we can't fill out the Project Review tab until we're finished with the Code Review tab. Workflow would be improved with either the ability to save feedback on the Project Review tab or a fix to the comment count bug.

* **Show amount available for each project on reviewer dashboard** <br>
It is annoying to have to click the Start button to see if there are any submissions available to review. It doesn't help that there isn't a keyboard shortcut to close the *No Submissions Available* popup.

* **Ability to input payment information within reviewer dashboard** <br>
Right now we send payment info (Udacity email, Paypal email, Country of Residence) to Janhavi via email. It'd be better if the reviewer dashboard included a simple reviewer profile where we could input these details.

* **Ability to see previous reviews/submissions of a student project** <br>
This will help avoid repeating comments and suggestions when evaluating a project. Many students mention they made changes to their code based on a previous review; if you weren't the reviewer, it's difficult to know what they changed and what you should focus on in this new review (i.e. check the corrections and see what else needs to corrected or could be improved!)

* **Grading tool should compile project** <br>
  and if there are errors, student is prompted to fix it and resubmit.

* **Grading tool should check if all the required files have been submitted.**
