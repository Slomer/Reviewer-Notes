* **Ability to input payment information within reviewer dashboard** <br>
Right now we send payment info (Udacity email, Paypal email, Country of Residence) to Janhavi via email. It'd be better if the reviewer dashboard included a simple reviewer profile where we could input these details.

* **Ability to see previous reviews/submissions of a student project** <br>
This will help avoid repeating comments and suggestions when evaluating a project. Many students mention they made changes to their code based on a previous review; if you weren't the reviewer, it's difficult to know what they changed and what you should focus on in this new review (i.e. check the corrections and see what else needs to corrected or could be improved!)

* **Grading tool should compile project** <br>
  and if there are errors, student is prompted to fix it and resubmit.

* **Grading tool should check if all the required files have been submitted.**

* **Access to a list of past reviews you've completed, with the ability to access each review** <br>
This would help keep track of the amount of reviews completed, and let us review our prior work.
