* **Ability to delete comments on Code Review tab** <br>
Sometimes I'll save a comment, but later on it doesn't mesh well with my other ones.

* **Ability to save feedback on Project Review tab** <br>
If you ever refresh the page while doing a review you will lose any feedback left in the Project Review area. A lot of us refresh to get the correct comment count to show up on the Code Review tab, which means we can't fill out the Project Review tab until we're finished with the Code Review tab. Workflow would be improved with either the ability to save feedback on the Project Review tab or a fix to the comment count bug.
