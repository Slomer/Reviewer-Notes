* **How does payment work?** <br>
  You will be paid via Paypal at the begining of each month for the reviews done in the prior month.
e.g. For the reviews completed in March 2015, you will be paid at the begining of April 2015.

* **Why is the comment count wrong on the Code Review tab?** <br>
  This is a known bug. Whenever you edit a comment, the system counts it as an additional comment. You
can get the correct comment count by refreshing the page. Refreshing the page will delete any feedback
you've left on the Project Review tab, so most of us don't fill out the Project Review tab until we're finished with the Code Review tab.
