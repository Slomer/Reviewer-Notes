#Becoming a Udacity Code Reviewer
##SPECS

###Simplify Code:
Can this code be simplified somehow?


Examples:
	- [Muddy and oversized classes, liar functions and commented out code](http://joostdevblog.blogspot.ie/2015/01/what-most-young-programmers-need-to.html)
	- [Functions that are too long](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/475675/when-is-a-function-too-long)


###Practice Kindness:
It is always important to remember that the review is being provided to a student who has invested several hours of their lives into the project we are reviewing.


	- [Stack Overflow Model](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice)

	In short:

	###Be Nice.

	- Rudeness and belittling language are not okay.

	- Be welcoming, be patient, and assume good intentions.

	- Don't be a jerk.

	Example:
		- [Highlighting Awesome Code Snippets](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-gr001/l-3562098906/m-3647758553)
		-


###Explain Why and with Examples:
Explain why using online references and create code snippets with [Github's Gist Tool](https://gist.github.com/). Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others.
