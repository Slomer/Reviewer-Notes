- Classic Arcade, 4862, Comment from a reviewer - code provided for review is the best one I ever seen in this kind of assignment. It is demonstrating student made great effort to understand JavaScript specifics. If there could be any negative comment - for this particular assignment provided solution is classical example of "over engineering", but as an programming exercise it is still great.
